We're the Smart Flanders team for open Summer of Code 2018 and we have only one purpose: _making Flanders smart again!_
Our team consists of only three people: 

  - [Lieselot Geirnaert](https://github.com/LieselotGeirnaert)
  - [Thibault Lesuisse](https://github.com/ThibaultLesuisse)
  - [Dylan Van Assche](https://www.github.com/DylanVanAssche)
  
Within the next weeks, we will keep a blog about our problems and solutions that we faced in the world of Linked Open Data.
